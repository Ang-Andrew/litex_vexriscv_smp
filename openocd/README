[> How to use
------------------

1. Compile https://github.com/SpinalHDL/openocd_riscv

2. Booting linux through JTAG :
   PATH_TO_OPENOCD_RISCV/src/openocd -s PATH_TO_OPENOCD_RISCV/tcl -c 'set CPU0_YAML openocd/cpu0.yaml' -f openocd.cfg -c 'set cpu_count SOC_CPU_COUNT' -f openocd/soc_init.cfg -f openocd/linux_boot.cfg

Note that currently, the JTAG will only properly work when the CPU is in machine mode (litex BIOS), once in linux you
will have to reset the board to reuse the JTAG as currently the debug reset isn't connected.
